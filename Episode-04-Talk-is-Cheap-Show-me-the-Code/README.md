# Namaste React ðŸš€ Episode 04- Talk is Cheap, Show me the Code

<p>This is the fourth episode of Namaste React ðŸš€ series by Akshay Saini.</p>
<p>In this episode, we jumped into the coding part. I learned and implemented Functional Components, uses of props, Component Composition and component rendering concepts. using these concepts we build a simple food ordering webpage where we used restaurant lists data from Swiggy and created a card component showing the list of restaurants dynamically in the webpage.</p>
<p>Here is the snapshot of what I build in this episode.</p><br/>
