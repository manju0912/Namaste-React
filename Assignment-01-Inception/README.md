<h3>2. Difference between a Library and Framework?</h3>
<p>Both a Library and Framework are reusable code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems in easier way.</p>
<h4>Library</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Collection of Functions:</strong> A library is a collection of pre-written functions or code snippets that perform specific tasks. These functions can be used by developers in their applications as needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Inversion of Control:</strong> In library, you decide when to use the library's functions, and you are responsible for the overall structure and flow of your application.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Libraries are often more flexible because you can use them as building blocks to create your own custom solutions. They don't dictate the overall structure of your application.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Framework</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Structured Environment:</strong> A framework is a pre-designed and structured environment for building applications. It includes a set of rules, conventions, and components that dictate the application's architecture.</li>
  <li><strong>Inversion of Control:</strong> The framework decides when to call your code based on predefined hooks or events.</li>
  <li><strong>Opinionated:</strong> Frameworks are often opinionated, meaning they have a specific way of doing things. They enforce a particular structure and coding style, which can lead to consistency but may limit flexibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?</h3>
<p>CDN, Content Delivery Network, is a network of servers that work together for faster delivery of content to the users distributed worldwide.</p>
<p>CDNs are used for many purposes. Some of them are given below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Faster Content Delivery:</strong> CDN stores the cached copies of website's content on servers distributed worldwide. When a user requests a webpage, the CDN serves the content from the server closest to the user's location. This reduces latency and ensures faster load times for your website.</li>
  <li><strong>DDoS Protection:</strong> CDNs often has built-in security measures to protect a website from DDoS attacks. They can absorb and mitigate the impact of malicious traffic.</li>
  <li><strong>Low Bandwidth Cost:</strong> With the help of caching and other optimizations, it minimizes the amount of data an origin server must provide, thus reducing the hosting cost.</li>
</ul>
