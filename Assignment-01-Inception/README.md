<h3>1. What is Emmet</h3>
<p>Emmet is a powerful and efficient tool for web developers and front-end designers that helps speed up the process of writing HTML and CSS code. It allows you to write code faster by using abbreviations and shortcuts, which are then expanded into full HTML and CSS code. </p>

<h3>2. Difference between a Library and Framework?</h3>
<p>Both a Library and Framework are reusable code written by someone else that is used to help solve common problems in easier way.</p>
<h4>Library</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Collection of Functions:</strong> A library is a collection of pre-written functions or code snippets that perform specific tasks. These functions can be used by developers in their applications as needed.</li>
  <li><strong>Inversion of Control:</strong> In library, you decide when to use the library's functions, and you are responsible for the overall structure and flow of your application.</li>
  <li><strong>Flexibility:</strong> Libraries are often more flexible because you can use them as building blocks to create your own custom solutions. They don't dictate the overall structure of your application.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Framework</h4>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Structured Environment:</strong> A framework is a pre-designed and structured environment for building applications. It includes a set of rules, conventions, and components that dictate the application's architecture.</li>
  <li><strong>Inversion of Control:</strong> The framework decides when to call your code based on predefined hooks or events.</li>
  <li><strong>Opinionated:</strong> Frameworks are often opinionated, meaning they have a specific way of doing things. They enforce a particular structure and coding style, which can lead to consistency but may limit flexibility.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. What is CDN? Why do we use it?</h3>
<p>CDN, Content Delivery Network, is a network of servers that work together for faster delivery of content to the users distributed worldwide.</p>
<p>CDNs are used for many purposes. Some of them are given below:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Faster Content Delivery:</strong> CDN stores the cached copies of website's content on servers distributed worldwide. When a user requests a webpage, the CDN serves the content from the server closest to the user's location. This reduces latency and ensures faster load times for your website.</li>
  <li><strong>DDoS Protection:</strong> CDNs often has built-in security measures to protect a website from DDoS attacks. They can absorb and mitigate the impact of malicious traffic.</li>
  <li><strong>Low Bandwidth Cost:</strong> With the help of caching and other optimizations, it minimizes the amount of data an origin server must provide, thus reducing the hosting cost.</li>
</ul>

<h3>4. Why is React known as React?</h3>
<p>React is known as React because of it's core concept. It is designed to help developers to build UIs that is fast, responsive, or Reactive.</p>

<h3>5. What is crossorigin in script tag?</h3>
<p>crossorigin in script tag is an attribute that is used for loading an external script from different domain to their domain. This attribute is used to protect the sensitive information from third party when fetching out the results.</p>

<h3>6. What is the difference between React and ReactDOM?</h3>
<h4>React</h4>
<ul>
  <li>React is a JS library for building UIs.</li>
  <li>It focuses on the structure of UI components and how they should behave in response to changes in data.</li>
  <li>React provides the core functionality for defining components, managing component state, and rendering UI elements.</li>
  <li>You typically use React when developing web and mobile applications to create reusable and interactive UI components.</li>
</ul>
<h4>ReactDOM</h4>
<ul>
  <li>ReactDOM is a package that specifically deals with rendering React components in web browser environment.</li>
  <li>It provides the necessary methods and APIs to render React components into the DOM of a web page.</li>
  <li>ReactDOM is used to bridge the gap between React's virtual DOM and actual DOM, ensuring that React components are displayed and updated on the web page.</li>
  <li>You use ReactDOM when you want to display React components within a web application.</li>
</ul>

<h3>7. What is the difference between react.development.js and react.production.js files via CDN</h3>
<h4>react.development.js</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This file is intended for development purposes.</li>
  <li>It includes additional runtime checks, warnings, error messages to help developers identify and fix issues in their code.</li>
</ul>
<h4>react.production.js</h4>
<ul>
  <li>This file is intended for production purposes.</li>
  <li>It omits the development-specific checks, warnings, error messages to optimize the performance and reduce the file size.</li>
</ul>

<h3>8. What are async and defer?</h3>
