# Namaste React ðŸš€ Episode 05- Let's Get Hooked

<p>This is the fifth episode of Namaste React ðŸš€ series by Akshay Saini.</p>
<p>In the previous episode we build a webpage using Swiggy's live api. So in this episode we followed the standard format that industry follows and rearranged our file/folder structure.</p>
<p>Put all of your components in a separate folder inside the `src` folder by creating their respective component files. The component file name must start with the capital letter and the name must match exactly same as the name of the Component.</p>

<p>We learned, there are two types of exports/imports.</p>
<p><strong>1. Default export/import:</strong> Modules can not default export/import multiple files from a single file.</p>
<ul>
    <li>export default Component;</li>
    <li>import Component from "/path/";</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>2. Named export/import:</strong> Named export/import is used when we have to export/import multiple elements from a single file.</p>
<ul>
    <li>export const Component</li>
    <li>import {Component} from "/path/";</li>
</ul>

# Hooks
- Hooks are built-in functions in React that allows us to use State or other React features. We use hooks directly inside the function component.<br/>

In this episode we learned about the useState Hook and implement it to create a filter button, which is filtering all the restaurants having average rating greater than 4.0.<br/>

<h4>useState Hook</h4>
<p>- useState() Hook is a very important Hook in React that is used to declare the State of a variable in React. Normally, variables disappear when we exit a function but state variables are preserved in React.<br/>
- The only argument we pass to the useState() hook is the initial state. The argument can be either a number or string only. Unlike classes, State doesn't have to be an object.<br/>
- useState() hook return a pair of values: the current state and the function that updates it.</p>
<code>
// importing the hook
import {useState} from 'react;

// Declaring a state variable
const [var, setVar] = useState();
</code>
