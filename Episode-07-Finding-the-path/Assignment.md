# Assignment 07 - Theory

<h3>1. What are various ways to add images into our App? Explain with code examples.</h3>
<p>In React, there are several ways to add images.</p>
<p>1. Using <strong><img></strong> Tag</p>
<code>
<img src="image.jpg" alt="" />
</code>
<p>2. Importing Images in JavaScript</p>
<code>
import React from 'react';
import myImage from './assets/image.jpg';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <img src={myImage} alt="" />
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;

</code>
<p>3. Using CSS for Background Images</p>
<code>
import React from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const divStyle = {
    backgroundImage: 'url(./assets/image.jpg)',
  };

  return (
    <div style={divStyle}>
      Content with a background image
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;

</code>

<h3>2. What would happen if we do console.log(useState())?</h3>
<p>If we do console.log(useState()), it will give an output in the console that provides the information about the useState hook in React. The output looks something like this:</p>
<code>Array [initialStateValue, function]</code>

<h3>3. How will useEffect behave if we don't add a dependency array?</h3>
<p>If we don't add a dependency array then the useEffect() hook will be called after every render.</p>

<h3>4. What is SPA?</h3>
<p>SPA stands for "Single Page Application". It's the web application or website. In SPA, the page is loaded and rendered once and we navigate to the different sections of the web app without reloading the entire page from the server.</p>
<p>SPAs results in smoother and faster UX.</p>

<h3>5. What is the difference between 'Client Side Routing' and 'Server Side Routing'?</h3>
<h4>Client Side Routing</h4>
<p>
- In Client Side Routing, routing is managed on the user's web browser.<br/>
- It is commonly used used in the SPAs.<br/>
- It gives smoother and faster UX as it doesn't reloads the entire page while routing.
</p>
<h4>Server Side Routing</h4>
<p>
- In server side routing, routing in managed on the web server.<br/>
- It is common in traditional web applications where each route is corresponds to a separate HTML page generated by the server.<br/>
- Server side routing can be slower for navigation as it involves the entire page to reload on each route change.
